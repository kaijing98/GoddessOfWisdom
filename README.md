A chrome extension that encourages pet owners to buy items with a lower carbon footprint

When users search for products on amazon, our chrome extension recommends similar products on E-bay with lower carbon footprint. If products are found, it will show up in the chrome extension and suggest for users to buy those products instead. Users can easily switch between e-commerce sites with the incorporation of blockchain (no multiple sign-in required) If no similar products are found, chrome extension will show a gif of a sad corgi. :(

Created during the Minerva Hackathon 2019, winner of the BlockChain category. Tech stack:
1) Blockchain incorporation achieved with block stack. (https://blockstack.org/) As part of our solution, we use block stack to securely store users' credentials for the different e-commerce sites. This creates a one-click platform for users to switch to different e-commerce sites to buy items with a lower carbon footprint

2) External API incorporated to calculate the carbon footprint of products users want to buy

3) Taps on the E-bay API to obtain information regarding the similar E-bay product.
